The aerial survey was carried out by Bluesky International Ltd. between June and September 2019. The point cloud data was captured at 4 points per square metre (ppm) and processed by Bluesky using the OSGM15 geoid model, OSTN15 horizontal transformation and Newlyn datum. The whole Outer Hebrides survey area had 11 ground control areas with RMSE values from 0.020m to 0.097m. The data is available as open data under an Open Government Licence. The 50 cm resolution data covers approximately 1705 km² including the area captured at the higher resolution of 25 cm.
