Cataloging scenarios

# Collection naming convention
Naming convention as follows:  
project/productset/x/y/z/version

Where x/y/z are for product specific differentiation.
No version exists for the top level product. previous version would have vX attributed.
Version numbers start at 1 except in very special cases as these are all release products.

Ie  
Top level  
eodip/sentinel1/ard/backscatter  

Previous versions
eodip/sentinel1/ard/backscatter/v2  
eodip/sentinel1/ard/backscatter/v1  

Records for previous data that has expired and been deleted should be removed from the catalog

Examples:
eodip/sentinel1/ard/backscatter  
scotland-gov-gi/lidar-1/processed/dsm  
scotland-gov-gi/lidar-1/processed/dsm/gridded/27700/100000 


# Use cases for the storage of catalog data

Principals
- The product is a physical element of data for example and s2 ard product or a wms layer
- A collection is a set of products and is not in itself an element of data

## Handling products that are a composition of other smaller products


Ie a wms layer for a collection of smaller products.

Example:

Scottish lidar data consists of: 
- A set of raw las files
- DSM and DTM 100 K tifs
- A uk wide dsm and wms layer

The data is dividid into collections of like products. 

scotland-gov-gi/lidar-1/processed/dsm
